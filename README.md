This is originally <https://github.com/Athas/EggsML>, an eccentric Danish IRC bot.

I have ripped out the Python bits, since it's not [suckless](http://suckless.org/).

`concieggs_irc` connects you to IRC with [ii](http://tools.suckless.org/ii)

`concieggs` is the tool that watches the resulting ~/irc hierarchy for messages
